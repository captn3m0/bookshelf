Just kidding.


## About

This project runs once a week, fetches my [Goodreads profile][2] and generates [a page][1] with its content. Inspired by [Frank Chimero][0], but since I’m not as good of a designer as he is, I put my effort into automating it.


## Goals

I’ve looked into a few tools to put this together, but I soon realised that not much was needed. No fancy technologies or front-end frameworks. There was no need to make this anymore complicated than a static page. The only new things I’ve looked at were:
- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com), since I was interested in learning something beyond [Lodash](https://lodash.com);
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), so this project can tap into this new feature to generate the required [static page][1].
